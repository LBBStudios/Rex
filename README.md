# Rex
Proof-of-concept for Rex, a web-based media library organizer.

## Goal
The goal for Rex is to be a web-based organizer for your own library of movies, while being as lightweight and easy to modify as possible.
A big feature I'm planning to add is to be able to watch videos in sync with someone you share a link with.

## Set-up
This will require you use MySQL as a server and import the database structure.
You will also need to get a OMDB api key at: http://omdbapi.com/
Fill in the details in config.php, in the root directory.
